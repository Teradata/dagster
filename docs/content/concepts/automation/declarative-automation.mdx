# Declarative Automation

<Note>
  This feature is currently <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

Dagster can automatically execute assets or checks when criteria are met, enabling a declarative approach to automation. Instead of defining explicit workflows and schedules, you describe the conditions under which they should be executed, and the system executes runs in response.

Declarative Automation includes pre-built conditions to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but conditions can be customized in a fine-grained manner, allowing precise control over when work gets executed.

---

## Benefits

Using Declarative Automation helps you:

- Ensure you're working with the most up-to-date data
- Optimize resource usage by only materializing assets or executing checks when needed
- Simplify how your team understands their assets by consolidating all asset logic to a single location
- Avoid thinking about specific workflow boundaries, such as a [schedule accounting for timezones or Daylight Savings Time](/concepts/automation/schedules/customizing-executing-timezones)

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Sensor definitions](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors)
- [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations)

---

## How it works

Declarative Automation is an automation method that executes runs when conditions are met. This method contains two main components:

- **An automation condition (<PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />**), which represents when an individual asset or check should be executed.
- **A sensor (<PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" />**), which evaluates each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> and launches runs in response to their status.

### Automation conditions

Automation conditions describe the conditions under which work should be executed. Dagster provides three pre-built conditions:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >
        Name
      </th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "40%",
        }}
      >
        Description
      </th>
      <th>Useful for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.on_cron(cron_schedule)</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset on a provided cron schedule,
        after all of its parents have been updated
      </td>
      <td>
        Regularly updating an asset without worrying about the specifics of how
        its parents update
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.on_missing()</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset if all its dependencies have
        been updated, but the asset itself has not.
      </td>
      <td>
        Filling in partitioned assets as soon as upstream data is available.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.eager()</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset:
        <ul>
          <li>If the asset has never been materialized before, or</li>
          <li>
            When the asset's parents update, as long as none of the parents are
            currently missing or have an update in progress
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul
          style={{
            marginTop: "0px",
          }}
        >
          <li
            style={{
              marginTop: "0px",
            }}
          >
            Automatically propagating changes through the asset graph
          </li>
          <li>Ensuring assets remain up-to-date</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

With assets, automation conditions can be set on the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator or on an <PyObject object="AssetSpec" />:

```python
from dagster import AssetSpec, AutomationCondition, asset

@asset(automation_condition=AutomationCondition.eager())
def my_eager_asset(): ...

AssetSpec("my_cron_asset", automation_condition=AutomationCondition.on_cron("@daily"))
```

The same is true for asset checks:

```python
from dagster import AssetCheckResult, AssetCheckSpec, AutomationCondition, asset_check


@asset_check(asset=..., automation_condition=AutomationCondition.cron_tick_passed("@daily"))
def expensive_check() -> AssetCheckResult:
    return AssetCheckResult(passed=True)


AssetCheckSpec(
    "expensive_check",
    asset=...,
    automation_condition=AutomationCondition.cron_tick_passed("@daily"),
)
```

The core <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> framework is extremely flexible, allowing you to build custom conditions from the ground up. Refer to the [Customizing automation conditions guide](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/customizing-automation-conditions) for more information.

### Sensors

When automation conditions for an asset are met, a sensor will execute a run to materialize the asset. This sensor, named `default_automation_condition_sensor`, will be available for each code location and monitor all assets within that location. To use multiple sensors or change the properties of the default sensor, refer to the <PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" /> documentation.

For an automation condition sensor to run, it must be turned on and an active [`dagster-daemon` process](/deployment/dagster-daemon) must be running. If you used [`dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver](/guides/running-dagster-locally), the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the sensor's evaluation history will be visible in the UI:

<!-- ![Default automation sensor evaluations in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png) -->

<Image
alt="Default automation sensor evaluations in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png"
width={1898}
height={863}
/>

You'll also be able to view a detailed history of each asset's evaluations on the asset's [**Asset Details** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#asset-details). This allows you to see why an asset was or wasn't materialized at different points in time:

<!-- ![Automation condition evaluations in the Asset Details page](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/evaluations-asset-details.png) -->

/>

## Getting started

To use Declarative Automation, you'll need to enable the automation condition sensor in the Dagster UI:

1. Navigate to **Overview > Sensors**
2. Locate the desired code location.
3. In the code location, toggle the `default_automation_condition_sensor` sensor to on.

From here, you can:

- Define custom automation conditions
- View a history of each evaluation for the sensor
- Navigate to individual assets to see a history of their evaluations
