# Creating custom Declarative Automation conditions

<Note>
  Declarative Automation is currently <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

[Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation) includes pre-built conditions to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but you can also customize conditions.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" pluralize /> work and how to create your own custom conditions.

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Declarative Automation](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation)

---

## How it works

Each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> consists of a set of **operands** and various **operators**. To create conditions that suit your specific needs, you can combine the operators and operands listed below. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
)
```

This condition translates to **Any upstream dependencies (parents) part of an in-progress run or failed during the latest run**.

### Operands

Operands are base conditions which can be true or false about a given asset partition.

| Operand                                     | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AutomationCondition.missing`               | The asset partition has never been materialized or observed                                                                       |
| `AutomationCondition.in_progress`           | The asset partition is part of an in-progress run                                                                                 |
| `AutomationCondition.failed`                | The asset partition failed to be materialized in its latest run                                                                   |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_updated`         | The asset partition was materialized since the previous evaluation                                                                |
| `AutomationCondition.newly_requested`       | The asset partition was requested on the previous evaluation                                                                      |
| `AutomationCondition.code_version_changed`  | The asset has a new code version since the previous evaluation                                                                    |
| `AutomationCondition.cron_tick_passed`      | A new tick of the provided cron schedule occurred since the previous evaluation                                                   |
| `AutomationCondition.in_latest_time_window` | The asset partition falls within the latest time window of the assetâ€™s <PyObject object="PartitionsDefinition" />, if applicable. |
| `AutomationCondition.will_be_requested`     | The asset partition will be requested in this tick                                                                                |

### Operators

The above conditions can be built into more complex expressions using the following operators:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "40%",
        }}
      >
        Operator
      </th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>~</code> (tilde)
      </td>
      <td>
        NOT; condition is not true; ex: <code>~A</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>|</code> (pipe)
      </td>
      <td>
        OR; either condition must be true; ex: <code>A | B</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>&</code> (ampersand)
      </td>
      <td>
        AND; both conditions must be true; ex: <code>A & B</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>A.newly_true()</code>
      </td>
      <td>Condition A was false on the previous evaluation and is now true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>A.since(B)</code>
      </td>
      <td>Condition A became true more recently than Condition B.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(A)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Condition A is true for any upstream partition. Can be used with{" "}
        <code>.allow()</code> and <code>.ignore()</code> to target specific
        upstream assets. Refer to the{" "}
        <a href="#targeting-dependencies">Targeting dependencies</a> section for
        an example.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.all_deps_match(A)</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Condition A is true for at least one partition of each upstream asset.
        Can be used with <code>.allow()</code> and <code>.ignore()</code> to
        target specific upstream assets. Refer to the{" "}
        <a href="#targeting-dependencies">Targeting dependencies</a> section for
        an example.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>AutomationCondition.any_downstream_condition()</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Any <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> on a downstream asset
        evaluates to true
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Composite conditions

Finally, there are a set of pre-built conditions which make it easier to construct common combinations of the above conditions.

| Condition                                         | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_updated`            | Any dependencies have been updated since the previous evaluation                       |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing`            | Any dependencies have never been materialized or observed                              |
| `AutomationCondition.any_deps_in_progress`        | Any dependencies are part of an in-progress run                                        |
| `AutomationCondition.all_deps_updated_since_cron` | All dependencies have been updated since the latest tick of the provided cron schedule |

---

## Modifying policies

It's common to have use cases similar to pre-built policies but with minor differences. While it is always possible to copy the base implementation and modify it as needed, it can often be simpler to use the `.without()` method to remove the unwanted sub-conditions or add additional conditions with the `&` operator.

### `AutomationCondition.eager()`: Ignoring missing dependencies

By default, `AutomationCondition.eager()` will not materialize an asset partition if it has any missing dependencies. If it is expected to have missing upstream data, remove `~AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing()` from the eager policy to allow execution:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

condition = AutomationCondition.eager().without(
  ~AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing(),
)
```

### `AutomationCondition.eager()`: Update older time partitions

By default, `AutomationCondition.eager()` will only update the latest time partition of an asset. If updates to historical partitions should result in downstream updates, then this sub-condition can be removed:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

condition = AutomationCondition.eager().without(
  AutomationCondition.in_latest_time_window(),
)
```

## Targeting dependencies

Upstream assets commonly influence downstream materialization decisions. To create automation conditions that target dependencies, use the `AutomationCondition.any_deps_match()` operator. This operator takes an arbitrary <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, applies it to each upstream asset, and then maps the results to the corresponding downstream partitions.

This operator and `AutomationCondition.all_deps_match()` can be further customized to only target specific sets of upstream assets by using `.allow()` and `.ignore()`.

For example, to target updates from a specific asset group, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `newly_updated` operand and tell it to target only the `metrics` asset group:

```python
from dagster import AssetSelection, AutomationCondition

AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.newly_updated()
).allow(AssetSelection.groups("metrics"))
```

Or to ignore missing partitions from an upstream asset, you can use `any_deps_match` with the `missing` operand and tell it to ignore a specific asset:

```python
AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.missing()
).ignore(AssetSelection.keys("taxi_trips"))
```

Note that these `ignore()` and `allow()` methods also work for composite conditions such as `AutomationCondition.any_deps_missing()` or `AutomationCondition.any_deps_updated()`.

## Describing conditions with labels

When there are a large number of sub-conditions that make up an <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />, it can be difficult to understand and troubleshoot the condition. To make conditions easier to understand, you can attach labels to sub-conditions, which will then display in the Dagster UI.

Arbitrary string labels can be attached to any node in the <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> tree by using the `with_label()` method, allowing you to describe the purpose of a specific sub-condition. For example:

```python
from dagster import AutomationCondition

in_progress_or_failed_parents = AutomationCondition.any_deps_match(
    AutomationCondition.in_progress() | AutomationCondition.failed()
).with_label("Any parents in progress or failed")
```

Then, when viewing evaluation results in the UI, the label will display next to the condition:

<!-- ![Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png) -->

<Image
alt="Any parents in progress or failed condition label in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label.png"
width={1576}
height={418}
/>

Hovering over or expanding the label will display its sub-conditions:

<!-- ![Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png) -->

<Image
alt="Expanded Any parents in progress or failed condition label with a list of sub-conditions in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/condition-label-expanded.png"
width={1576}
height={593}
/>
